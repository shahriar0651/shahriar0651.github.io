I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, working in the Complex Network and Security Research (CNSR) Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Wenjing Lou](https://people.cs.vt.edu/wenjing/). My research lies at the intersection of cyber-physical systems (CPS), artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity. I focus on uncovering and mitigating security vulnerabilities in safety-critical CPS---particularly in embodied AI systems such as connected and autonomous vehicles---by developing scalable, attack-resilient, and trustworthy AI frameworks that can operate safely under real-world uncertainty and adversarial conditions.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:

- **Cyber-Physical Systems Security**: Securing safety-critical systems like smart grids and autonomous vehicles
- **Trustworthy AI**: Developing robust machine learning models resilient to adversarial and backdoor attacks
- **Intrusion Detection**: Designing deep learning-based frameworks for detecting attacks in CAN and V2X networks
- **Generative AI for Security**: Using GANs for threat modeling and misbehavior detection

## Current Research

My Ph.D. research integrates cybersecurity, machine learning, and CPS to develop robust, resilient, and trustworthy AI for connected and autonomous vehicles. I have designed intrusion detection systems for CAN and V2X networks to counter stealthy and adversarial attacks, investigated network-induced and multimodal fusion attacks on autonomous perception, and developed a unified defense framework that mitigates both adversarial and backdoor ML threats across diverse modalities.
