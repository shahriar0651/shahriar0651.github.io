I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Virginia Tech, working in the Complex Network and Security Research (CNSR) Lab under the supervision of [Dr. Wenjing Lou](https://people.cs.vt.edu/wenjing/). My research lies at the intersection of cyber-physical systems (CPS), artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity. **I am actively seeking tenure-track faculty opportunities starting in Fall 2026.**



## Current Research

My research advances the security and resilience of intelligent cyber-physical systems (CPS) as they evolve into embodied, AI-driven agents that perceive, decide, and act in the physical world. As AI/ML becomes deeply embedded in vehicles, robots, and critical infrastructure, these systems face fundamentally new risks—arising from cyberattacks, adversarial manipulation of ML models, and vulnerabilities created at the intersection of sensing, networking, and decision-making. My research aims to ensure that such embodied intelligent systems remain **safe**, **trustworthy**, and **dependable** under real-world uncertainty and adversarial conditions. At the core of my work is a unifying question: *How can we design intelligent CPS that maintain reliable operation even when attacks target the physical platform (“the body”), the AI algorithms (“the brain”), or the interface connecting them?* To address this, I pursue two complementary directions—**AI for security** and **security of AI**—with an emphasis on securing the next generation of embodied, intelligent, and autonomous CPS.

## **Research Interests**

* **Trustworthy & Robust AI** — advancing reliable, resilient, and secure machine learning models.
* **Cyber-Physical Systems Security** — safeguarding intelligent and safety-critical CPS from cyber and physical threats.
* **Intelligent & Embodied CPS (AI + CPS)** — securing AI-driven autonomous systems where sensing, networking, and learning converge.
