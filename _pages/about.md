I am an Amazon Fellow and PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/), where I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in the [Complex Network and Security Research (CNSR) Lab](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Wenjing Lou](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/WJLou.html). My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis on applications to cyber-physical systems, including connected and autonomous vehicles.
